# [Recipe [React]](https://th3az-react-recipe.herokuapp.com/)
An app that I built for an online challenge. \
It was just about making an exact-like design of a couple of webpage images of the same website. \
Recipe images are lazy loaded on the page and each recipe can be viewed by 3 different ways. \
 - List Card
 - Overlay Card/Window
 - Full Page
Local search functionality is there to allow searching of recipe by name.

### Modules that are implemented:
 - List Recipes [List Card View]
 - Quick View [Overlay Card/Window]
 - Recipe Details [Full Page]
 - Search Recipe [Local]
